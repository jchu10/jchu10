    "text": "Hi there! I am a cognitive scientist studying the playful mind. Play is a universal feature of early childhood, easily recognized yet tricky to define. Why do we play, and what is it good for?\nStudying how people engage in a variety of playful behaviors allows us to answer many questions about human cognition, motivation, and development. I’m specifically interested in:\n\nHow people flexibly create, select, and solve new problems;\nWhen and why we are motivated to do so;\nHow these processes change as we develop, learn, and interact with others\n\nI tackle these questions using experimental and computational methods. In the long term, I aim to broadly inform theories of learning, exploration, and discovery, as well as improve children’s educational and life outcomes.\nCurrently I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Harvard CoCoDev Labs, working with Tomer Ullman and Elizabeth Bonawitz. I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at MIT working with Laura Schulz."
