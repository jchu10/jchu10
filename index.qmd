Hi there! I am a cognitive scientist studying the **playful mind**. Play is a universal feature of early childhood, easily recognized yet tricky to define. Why do we play, and what is it good for?

Studying how people engage in a variety of playful behaviors allows us to answer many questions about human cognition, motivation, and development. I'm specifically interested in:

(1) How people flexibly create, select, and solve new problems;
(2) When and why we are motivated to do so;
(3) How these processes change as we develop, learn, and interact with others

I tackle these questions using experimental and computational methods. In the long term, I aim to broadly inform theories of learning, exploration, and discovery, as well as improve children's educational and life outcomes.

Currently I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Judy Fan ([Cognitive Tools Lab](http://cogtoolslab.github.io/)) and Hyowon Gweon ([Social Learning Lab](http://sll.stanford.edu)). I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at MIT working with [Laura Schulz](https://eccl.mit.edu).
