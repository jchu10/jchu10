Postdoctoral scientist, Harvard University

Hi there! I am a cognitive scientist studying the **playful mind**. Play is a universal feature of early childhood, easily recognized yet tricky to define. Why do we play, and what is it good for? 

My current research focuses on one distinguishing element of play: the creation of new problems and plans. I'm interested in questions such as: (1) How do people propose new goals, including games to play, problems to solve, and questions to ask? (2) How do we flexibly assess and select among these goals, and create new plans and hypotheses to achieve them? (3) When and why is it intrinsically rewarding to engage in these activities?

I tackle these questions using experimental, developmental, and computational methods. By characterizing the nature and development of creative problem-solving and problem-setting, I aim to broadly inform theories of learning, exploration, and discovery, as well as improve children's educational and life outcomes. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, working with Tomer Ullman and Elizabeth Bonawitz. I earned my Ph.D. in Cognitive Science at MIT working with Laura Schulz.
